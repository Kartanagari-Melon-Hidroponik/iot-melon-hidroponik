# IoT Hydroponic System

## Overview

This project implements an IoT (Internet of Things) system for managing a hydroponic gardening setup. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using nutrient-rich water. The IoT system provides remote monitoring and control capabilities for the hydroponic system, allowing users to track environmental conditions and automate tasks such as watering and nutrient distribution.

## Features

- **Remote Monitoring:** Monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and pH level of the nutrient solution remotely via a web interface or a mobile application.
- **Automated Control:** Automate watering schedules based on predefined thresholds and control nutrient distribution to optimize plant growth.
- **Alerting:** Receive real-time alerts via email or SMS when environmental conditions fall outside of specified ranges or when system malfunctions occur.
- **User Interface:** Intuitive user interface for easy configuration and monitoring of the hydroponic system.

## Components

- **Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 and ESP8266):** Controls sensors, actuators, and communicates with the IoT platform.
- **Sensors:** Measure environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH level, and nutrient levels.
- **Actuators:** Control pumps, valves, and other devices for automated watering and nutrient distribution.
- **IoT Platform:** Handles data transmission, storage, and processing. This could be a cloud-based platform like AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT, or a self-hosted solution.
- **User Interface:** Web-based or mobile application for user interaction and monitoring.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup:** Assemble the necessary hardware components including microcontroller, sensors, actuators, and connect them according to the provided schematics.
2. **Software Installation:** Install the required libraries and dependencies on the microcontroller. Set up the IoT platform and configure communication protocols.
3. **Configuration:** Configure the system parameters such as thresholds for environmental conditions, watering schedules, and alerting mechanisms.
4. **User Interface Setup:** Set up the user interface for accessing and controlling the hydroponic system remotely.
5. **Testing and Deployment:** Test the system thoroughly to ensure proper functionality. Deploy the system in the desired location.

## Usage

1. Access the web interface or mobile application to monitor the hydroponic system remotely.
2. Set up automated tasks such as watering schedules and nutrient distribution based on plant requirements.
3. Monitor environmental parameters and receive alerts in case of any anomalies or system malfunctions.
4. Analyze historical data to optimize growing conditions and maximize plant growth.
